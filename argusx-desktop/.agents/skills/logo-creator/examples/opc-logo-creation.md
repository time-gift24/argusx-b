# Example: Creating OPC Skills Logo

**User:** Create a logo for opc.dev - it's a website for agent skills for one person companies.

**Agent:** I'll help you create a logo for OPC Skills. Let me ask a few questions first:

1. Style preference? (Pixel art, minimalist, 3D, hand-drawn, etc.)
2. Aspect ratio? 1:1 square for favicon/icons?
3. Color preferences? Monochrome or specific colors?
4. Any reference images to draw inspiration from?

**User:** Please refer to this pixel art mule logo - I like the 8-bit retro style with black pixels on white background.

**Agent:** Got it! The reference is a classic pixel art style:
- Black pixels on white background
- 8-bit retro aesthetic
- Simple, recognizable silhouette

I'll generate 20 pixel art logo variations for OPC Skills.

Generating with prompts like:
- "Pixel art robot head logo, 8-bit retro style, black pixels on white background"
- "Pixel art crowned person, 8-bit style, solopreneur king"
- "Pixel art lightning bolt, 8-bit, black on white"

Here are the generated logos:

![Logo 09](/skills/logo-creator/examples/images/logo-09.png)

**User:** I like #09 with the crowned person - it represents "king of your own company". Please create 20 more variations of that concept.

**Agent:** Generating 20 variations of the "Crowned Person" concept...

Here are the variations:

**User:** The original #09 looks best. Please crop it to fit a 1:1 square, remove background, and convert to SVG.

**Agent:** Processing the logo through finalization steps:

1. Cropping to 1:1 square (removing margins)
2. Removing background for transparency
3. Converting to SVG for scalability

![Selected](/skills/logo-creator/examples/images/opc-logo-selected.png)
![Final SVG](/skills/logo-creator/examples/images/opc-logo-final.svg)

The SVG is now ready for web use, favicons, and print!
